Here this council discussed several matters of great importance to our Holy Catholic Church. One such of those matters, and perhaps the one most relevant to our own affairs, was that regarding the treatment of Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land. According to firsthand accounts, the Pilgrim's road is rife with danger, and the faithful suffer all manner of abuse as they travel to Jerusalem.\n\n In order to protect [main_character.GetHerHis] flock, [main_character.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted the possibility of an armed pilgramage to restore the Holy Land to Christian control."

The Romans, who have stood firm as Christianity's bulwark in the east for centuries, are now failing to defend against the unrelenting attacks by it's eastern neighbors.\n\nSeemingly moved by the Emperor's plea, [main_character.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted the possibility of sending a joint Christian force to Byzantine aid."

If Christ's soldiers marched to the Holy Land, would he not scatter the infidel as he had the Philistines long ago? \n\n One ragged [pope_urban.GetWomanMan] from France in particular certainly advocates these beliefs, as we've received word that [pope_urban.GetSheHe] has been roaming from town to town upon [pope_urban.GetHerHis] donkey, mesmerizing crowds with [pope_urban.GetHerHis] fiery, passionate preaching, and according to our reports, has amassed thousands of followers."
